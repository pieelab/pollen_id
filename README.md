# The Machine Learning for the [Sticky Pi project](https://sticky-pi.github.io)

--------------------------------
## Project organisation:

* `src` -- the Python package (`sticky_pi_ml`) that defines all the tools, data structure and implement all algorithms as described in the publication.
* `jobs` -- a set of jobs to train and apply ML models on our dataset. These are slurm jobs that wrap around the package's tools to be run on HPC platforms.
